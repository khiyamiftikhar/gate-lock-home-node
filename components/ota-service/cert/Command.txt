
Two certificates are required, one for the manifest.json and other for the firmware download

Use github bash bcz it already has ssl

For manifest
echo | openssl s_client -servername khiyamiftikhar.github.io -connect khiyamiftikhar.github.io:443 -showcerts > github_io_certs.txt

For firmware

echo | openssl s_client -servername github.com -connect github.com:443 -showcerts > github_com_certs.txt


Now from both files copy the last (root) certificate in to a single file and include that file in cmakelist

while copying make sure to include that begin of cert and end of cert. and give space between two certs



another command
curl -o aaa_root.pem https://crt.sh/?d=331986
